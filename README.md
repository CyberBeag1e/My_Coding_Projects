# Coding-Portfolio-for-Fall-2023

I'm applying for my master's degree in data science / analytics. This repository is set for keeping my coding projects and recoding my progress in programming.

I include several scripts for my coding projects, some of which are final projects of courses, while others are for my interst, using programming to facilitate my study and calculations in my homeworks.

I'm not a computer science major, so there's no comprehensive projects in my portfolio, and maybe some syntax is a little "na√Øve". However, I'm working hard on it, building up my programming knowledge and making my scripts simpler and more efficient.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at ksiri777@outlook.com
